        Vigtory was a Chicago-based sportsbook where I worked on the Android and
        iOS app. The app is built with React Native and TypeScript and uses a
        GraphQL API. I am enjoying working in the fast-paced environment of a
        start-up where I am being challenged on a daily basis.

        <strong>Developer Intern</strong>

        Ecolab was my first experience working in the corporate world. I learned
        a lot about collaborating with a team on a software solution. Working
        with a product manager, presenting and delivering the product was a
        valuable experience. My biggest challenges were dealing with changing
        requirements and importing the data we were given into a database. What
        I enjoyed the most was learning and applying new techniques to our
        project like MVC, authentication, and authorization.
