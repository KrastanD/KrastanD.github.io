        My alma mater. Of the 61 credits hours I took, 52 were computer science
        courses. I managed to get my degree in only two years with the help of
        my college and AP credits. I enjoyed my time there thoroughly and
        learned so much from the brilliant professors and fellow students. My
        focus was on Big Data, because I took courses about databases,
        artificial intelligence and machine learning. I took classes in many
        other fields though, as I love how broad computer science is and how
        much there is to learn.

        A community college in the suburbs of Chicago where I took the majority
        of my Gen-Eds and engineering requirements. I had to keep a 4.0 GPA
        prior to applying to UIUC while working 20 hours per week. I learned a
        lot about time management and how to get the most out of myself.

        My high school where I took my first computer science course and my love
        for programming began. I was also a four-year cross country and track
        and field runner.
