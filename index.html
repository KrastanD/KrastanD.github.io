          <strong class="s1strong">Bio:</strong>
          I am a software engineer and a curious individual by heart. Learning
          and relearning things is part of the trade and I am lucky to find it
          enjoyable. Finding bugs and performance improvements in the code drive
          me. It is like finding a hidden treasure every time. Testing and
          refactoring are also very important to me, because they make code
          better and life easier.

          My alma mater. Of the 61 credits hours I took, 52 were computer
          science courses. I managed to get my degree in only two years with the
          help of my college and AP credits. I enjoyed my time there thoroughly
          and learned so much from the brilliant professors and fellow students.
          My focus was on Big Data, because I took courses about databases,
          artificial intelligence and machine learning. I took classes in many
          other fields though, as I love how broad computer science is and how
          much there is to learn.

          A community college in the suburbs of Chicago where I took the
          majority of my Gen-Eds and engineering requirements. I had to keep a
          4.0 GPA prior to applying to UIUC while working 20 hours per week. I
          learned a lot about time management and how to get the most out of
          myself.

          My high school where I took my first computer science course and my
          love for programming began. I was also a four-year cross country and
          track and field runner.
