          <strong class="s1strong">Bio:</strong>
          I am a software engineer and a curious individual by heart. Learning
          and relearning things is part of the trade and I am lucky to find it
          enjoyable. Finding bugs and performance improvements in the code drive
          me. It is like finding a hidden treasure every time. Testing and
          refactoring are also very important to me, because they make code
          better and life easier.

          My alma mater. Of the 61 credits hours I took, 52 were computer
          science courses. I managed to get my degree in only two years with the
          help of my college and AP credits. I enjoyed my time there thoroughly
          and learned so much from the brilliant professors and fellow students.
          My focus was on Big Data, because I took courses about databases,
          artificial intelligence and machine learning. I took classes in many
          other fields though, as I love how broad computer science is and how
          much there is to learn.

          A community college in the suburbs of Chicago where I took the
          majority of my Gen-Eds and engineering requirements. I had to keep a
          4.0 GPA prior to applying to UIUC while working 20 hours per week. I
          learned a lot about time management and how to get the most out of
          myself.

          Ecolab was my first experience working in the corporate world. I
          learned a lot about collaborating with a team on a software solution.
          Working with a product manager, presenting and delivering the product
          was a valuable experience. My biggest challenges were dealing with
          changing requirements and importing the data we were given into a
          database. What I enjoyed the most was learning and applying new
          techniques to our project like MVC, authentication, and authorization.

          <strong class="s3strongsecondary">Senior Computer Lab Aide</strong
          ><br />
          I worked in a diverse environment where I learned the importance of
          good customer service. I grew into the Senior Lab Aide position
          through hard work, dependability, and leadership skills. I led a
          rotation of at least 40 other lab aides on projects such as replacing
          faulty computers, setting up new environments, and updating academic
          software.
